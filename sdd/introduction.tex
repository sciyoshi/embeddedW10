\chapter*{Purpose of This Document}
This System Design Document (SDD) provides the reader with a general, yet complete description of an embedded digital audio amplification device. This includes all of the hardware components necessary, features and capabilities of these hardware components, and connections between each of these devices. This document will also describe the software components necessary, including operating system requirements, timing requirements, deadlines, program states, and interactions points between the user and the software based system. The design of the system which is described herein is a manifestation of the general requirements and deadlines listed in the System Requirements Specification (SRS), with some considerations into production feasibility and intuitive human interaction.
